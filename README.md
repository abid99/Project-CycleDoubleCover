A1 = [[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], ..., [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], representing the edges              between V1 and V2 to form H. 
A2 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] edges of H between the parts K3 to K1 and A3 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] between K2 to K3. 
Similarly for the remaining cases. 
Python programming language with networkx, numpy and scipy were used on OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 version.
